## Cool Mouse Cursor Drop \- Actually makes cursor bounce around\!\!\!


</div>

### Description

I thought this was something that would look cool for a screen saver, and you can do so much with it. It basically just shows you how to use the SetCursorPos to make the cursor fall and bounce. It uses basic laws of physics such as adding the effects of wind and gravity in. Please check out and rate. Oh, it also might work for other Visual Basics, I've just only tried it on Visual Basic 6. Give me feedback as well as ratings to please, that'd be very much appreciated, thanx.
